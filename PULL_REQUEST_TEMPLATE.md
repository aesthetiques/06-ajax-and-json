#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Caleb and Brianna paired together. It took about 1 hour.**

** Caleb and I did our work on this computer.

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started with getting JSON request from the data.
  2. Next, we if the request succeeds, we load all the data and render it to the page.
  3. Then, we made sure that we called the new Article.fetchAll.
  4. Then, we stringified our data to localStorage.
  5. Then in the if statement of the fetchAll function, we parsed localStorage as the argument of the function Article.loadAll.
  6. Last, we call the articleView.initIndexPage.
